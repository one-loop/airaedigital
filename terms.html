If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by COMPANY infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to Airae a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon Airae Agency actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to Airae Agency a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a> for details.
